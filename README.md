## QU

World 0 is complete. Qu is here. You're a guy with a poor memory who has no idea where he is. Unfortunately, he is trapped. And it looks like it's gonna take a whole lot of brains to get out. Fortunately, what he lacks in retention, he more than makes up for in cognition.
Good luck.

Pro Tip: If you get stuck, try interacting with different things in the world. Nothing is useless. Except for trees. They're for decoration. Oh, wait.
